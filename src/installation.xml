	        DDS supports Private and Shared installations.
	</para>
	<para>
	        A Private Installation - it is when a user installs DDS for individual usage in his/her local folder.
	        Any Private Installation can be used by other users as well. It's just a matter of file privileges.
	    </para>
	<para>
	        A Shared Installation - it is when a site administrator installs DDS
	        in some central location, so it can be shared by many users. This type of installation may be convenient for some users,
	        since they don't need to install DDS by their own. In case of a shared Installation
	        you need to execute one additional step, see <xref linkend="step5"/>. All the rest is the same as with Private Installations.
	    </para>
	<para>
	        Be advised, that in both cases DDS acts identically and always provides private clusters, one for each user.
	        In case of a shared installation, users share only binaries and configurations, but each user gets its own DDS instance and can't disturb other users.
	        Each user can tune DDS by changing the DDS user defaults configuration in <filename>$HOME/.DDS/DDS.cfg</filename>.

		<title>Step #1: Get the source</title>

			<para>
		   Unpack <application>DDS</application> tarball:
		<screen><command>tar -xzvf <replaceable>DDS-X.Y.Z-Source.tar.gz</replaceable></command></screen>
		   Tar will created a new directory <filename class="directory">./DDS-X.Y.Z-Source</filename>,
		   where <replaceable>X.Y.Z</replaceable> represents a version of <application>DDS</application>.
		   </para>
		</sect2>

	<sect1 xml:id="step2">
		<title>Step #2: Configure the source</title>
		<para>
	   Change to the DDS source directory:
	<screen>
<command>cd <replaceable>./DDS-X.Y.Z-Source</replaceable></command></screen>
	   You can adjust some configuration settings in the <filename>BuildSetup.cmake</filename> bootstrap file.
	   The following is a list of variables:
	   <table><title>DDS configuration variables</title><tgroup cols="2"><thead><row><entry>Variable</entry><entry>Description</entry></row></thead><tbody><row><entry>CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX</entry><entry>Install path prefix, prepended onto install directories.(default $HOME/DDS/[DDS_Version])</entry></row><row><entry>CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE</entry><entry>Set cmake build type. Possible options are: None, Debug, Release, RelWithDebInfo, MinSizeRel (default Release)</entry></row><row><entry>BUILD_DOCUMENTATION</entry><entry>Build source code documentation.

	   </para>
		<para>
	      Now, prepare a build directory for an out-of-source build and configure the source:
	<screen>
<command>mkdir build</command>
<command>cd build</command>
<command>cmake -C ../BuildSetup.cmake ..</command></screen>
	   </para>
		<tip>
			<para>
	       If for some reason, for example a missing dependency, configuration failed. After you get the issue fixed, right before starting the <command>cmake</command> command
	       it is recommended to delete everything in the build directory recursively. This will guaranty a clean build every time the
	       source configuration is restarted.
	    </para>
		</tip>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 xml:id="step3">
		<title>Step #3: Build and install</title>
		<para>
	      Issue the following commands to build and install DDS:
	<screen>
<command>make -j</command>
<command>make install</command></screen>
	      <note><title>Installation Prefix</title><para>
	         Please note, that by default <application>DDS</application> will be installed in <envar>$HOME</envar>/DDS/X.Y.Z, where X.Y.Z is a version of
	         <application>DDS</application>.
	         However users can change this behavior by setting the install prefix path in the bootstrap script <filename>BuildSetup.cmake</filename>.
	         Just uncomment the setting of CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX variable and change dummy MY_PATH_HERE to a desired path.
	      </para></note>
		  <tip><title>WN package</title><para>
		  Users have a possibility to additionally build DDS worker package for the local platform. In case if you have same OS types on all of the target machines and don't want to use WN packages from the DDS binary repository, just issue:
	  	<screen>
	  <command>make -j wn-bin</command>
	  <command>make install</command></screen>
	  the commands will build and install a DDS worker package for the given platform.
	      </para></tip>
	   </para>
	</sect1>
	<sect1 xml:id="step4">
		<title>Step #4: DDS Environment</title>
		<para>
	      In order to enable DDS's environment you need to source the <filename>DDS_env.sh</filename> script. Change to your newly installed DDS directory and issue:
	<screen>
<command>cd <replaceable>[DDS INSTALL DIRECTORY]</replaceable></command>
<command>source DDS_env.sh</command></screen>
	      You need to source this script every time before using <application>DDS</application> in a new system shell.
	      Simplify it by sourcing the script in your bash profile.
	   </para>
		<para>
	      Now the installation is done. But if you were preparing a shared installation, then please see the <xref linkend="step5"/> as well.
	      <!--important><para>
	       	If there were problems during the installation, please see <xref linkend="Support"/> or <xref linkend="Known_Issues"/>.

		<title>Step #5: DDS shared Installation</title>
		<para>TODO</para>
		<!--para>
	            If you installed DDS in some central location (by changing the default CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX, see <xref linkend="step2"/>),
	            than you need to make one simple additional step.
	        </para>
		<para>
	            Normally central installations or shared installations are restricted for read-only for users.
	            You therefore need to provide pre-compiled binaries for worker nodes, which are kept in <envar>$DDS_LOCATION</envar>, so that other users could simple re-use them.
	            To do that just issue the following command:
	        </para>
		<screen>
			<command>dds-server getbins</command>
		</screen>
		<para>
	            Next time (TO-DO) we will provide a documentation on how to prepare your own binaries for worker nodes.
